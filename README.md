# RiiBalanced Source Code/Code List

🎁ArcIntel's gift to the Mario Kart Wii community becomes my gift to aspiring Mario Kart Wii developers.

📣I will also explain briefly what the codes included in the game mode do along the changes i did to them.

🎈NOTE: I will not provide the MKRiibalanced vehicle stat file to the one's wondering.

💫Why? ArcIntel did all the vehicle related modding. I was just doing code related stuff!

## Ways to "Compile"

🍂There are two ways to "compile" all of this.

- 🌸The "Official" Way (AKA How it was done in the Official Modpack by Me)
- 🏵 And the "Dirty" Way (AKA an easier way, just messier in terms of code)

### 🍀What you will need (Official Way):

- 🍁Common Sense
- 🌼Wiimm's ISO Tools (WIT)
- 🍃boot.dol file matching with your Game's Region
- 🎡The Riivolution Homebrew App
- 🌵Basic Knowledge of Riivolution/XML

## 🎄How to compile the Source Code (Official Way)

- 🎫Download and Install WIT [here](https://wit.wiimm.de/download.html)
- 🧨Download the Riivolution Homebrew App [here](https://aerialx.github.io/rvlution.net/riivolution.zip)
- 🎇Download the "Riivolution" ZIP file included in this Repository
- 🎉Download the [main.dol](https://avsys.xyz/wiimmfi.zip) corresponding to your Game's Region (Go into one of the 4 Region Folders and then in "Wiimmfi" move the main.dol file to "YOURMODNAME" on your SD

Step 1
- 🎆Extract the contents of the **Riivolution Homebrew App** in your Apps folder in your SD/USB
- 🎭Extract the two folders that are inside the **Riivolution** ZIP file in your SD/USB's Root
- ✨Go onto this [website](https://mariokartwii.com/gct/)
- 🧧Paste your Cheat Code in "Paste your code here" and then Click on "Add Code" and then on "Download GCT" (GAME ID and Code Title can be named whatever you want)

It should look like this

❗ Add a SINGLE CHEAT CODE per GCT File! **If you want to have Multiple Cheat Codes loaded in your mod you need to:**
- Remove the previous code you added to your GCT File
