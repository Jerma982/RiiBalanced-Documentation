# RiiBalanced Source Code/Code List

🎁ArcIntel's gift to the Mario Kart Wii community becomes my gift to aspiring Mario Kart Wii developers.

📣I will also explain briefly what the codes included in the game mode do along the changes i did to them.

🎈NOTE: I will not provide the MKRiibalanced vehicle stat file to the one's wondering.

💫Why? ArcIntel did all the vehicle related modding. I was just doing code related stuff!

## How to "Compile"

🍂There are two ways to "compile" all of this.

- 🌸The "Official" Way (AKA How it was done in the Official Modpack by Me)
- 🏵 And the "Dirty" Way (AKA an easier way, just messier in terms of code)

### 🍀What you will need:

- 🍁Common Sense
- 🌼Wiimm's ISO Tools (WIT)
- 🍃boot.dol file matching with your Game's Region
- 🌵Basic Knowledge of Riivolution/XML
